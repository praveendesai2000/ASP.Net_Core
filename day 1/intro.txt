			ASP.net Core - This is a re-written framework 
			Purpose 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------			ASP.net core is a result / outcome of "WEB REVOLUTION"

	a. When was the first time you used Internet - World Average - 2007
	b. Why did u use internet for during those days - Email, surfing
	c. Where did u use internet - Home, Cyber cafe
	d. Source of Internet - Broadband, Wifi(rare), dial up - modem
	e. Devise used - Desktop - laptop(rare)

	Thus web developers used to create the web contents accordingly - as per 	hardware and internet

--------------------------------However things are differnt today ---------------
	1. Why do u use internet for ?? - Everything
	2. Where do u use internet ?? - Everywhere
	3. Source of Internet - Mobile Data - this way different from Wifi/broadband
		Speed - developer has to develop content which are lightweight
			users carry internet - make them run behind them
	4. Devise - Mobiles, tablets, watches, IOT devises etc..
		Habbits - video - tilt the phone from horizontal to vertical
			 image - zoom in - zoom out 
	5. Competition 
	6. Cloud and new technologies - Angular, React, Node, IOT, AI, ML etc...
	7. ASP.Net framework was not able to create apps for above change
		Thus MS rewrote the whole framework to make it 
			Light, cross platform and based on all the open design patterns
			MVC,
			ORM(EF), 
			REST standards(WebAPI), 
		develope anywhere, host/use anywhere with CLI and VSCode
